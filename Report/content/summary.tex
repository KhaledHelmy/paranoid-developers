\section{Project Description}
The project \textit{The Paranoid Developers} mainly demonstrates a system of collaborative code editing between different users on system. The project mainly elaborates encrypting the code of each user when saving in the database of the system. Basically when a user registers into the system he provides a passcode which is then used to encrypt his private key which will be used for encrypting his codes on the system and will be used further in the application where when a user provides the correct passcode he is allowed to view and edit all the code files that he has access to, however if the user provides a wrong passcode he views the codes that he has access to as encrypted codes and he is not allowed to edit in the codes.



\section{Features}
 Each user in the system is allowed to  \begin{itemize}
    \item Register on the system providing his email , password and the \textit{passcode}.
     \item Login to the system providing the same credentials.
    \item Write a new code
    \item  Show the submitted code 
    \item  Edit the code 
    \item Delete the Code 
    \item Give access to other users to view and edit his codes
    \item Deny other users the access to his codes
\end{itemize}
