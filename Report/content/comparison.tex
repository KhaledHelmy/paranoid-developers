\subsection{AES vs DES3}
AES is explained in details in the section \ref{featuer:aes}
Data Encryption Standard (DES) is an outdated symmetric-key method of data encryption. DES has been superseded by the more secure Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm. AES and DES almost work the same way with exception that AES is modified to be more secure. DES uses 56 bit key while AES can use 128, 192, or 256 bits key. DES encrypts blocks with size of 64 bits while AES encrypts blocks of size 128 bits. DES was widely used until is was proven inadequate. So to compensate the insecurity of DES people started using 3 layers of DES, so if a different key will be used in each layer we can achieve a key of length 168. However, due to the likelihood of a meet-in-the-middle attack, the effective security it provides is only 112 bits. 3DES encryption is obviously slower than plain DES.
\par So we went for AES-256 because  is efficient in both software and hardware implementations, uses 256 bits key over the 112 bits one and encrypts bigger blocks than DES 128 bits and 64 respectively. AES is much faster than DES3 because DES3 passes through 3 different layers of DES encryptions.
